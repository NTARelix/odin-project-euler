# Odin Euler Project

In an attempt to learn the basics of [Odin](http://odin-lang.org/) I have decided to create solutions to a few problems listed on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

This application was run against Odin version [dev-2025-01-nightly:2aae4cf](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/dev-2025-01).

To run all:

```bash
odin run .
```

To run last:

```bash
odin run . -- -1
```

To run 5th (or any other solution by number):
```bash
odin run . -- 5
```
